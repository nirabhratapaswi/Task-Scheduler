# Task-Scheduler

Task-Scheduler is a lightweight application built to auto-schedule your daily/weekly/monthly/yearly routine with the motto of "Time Management? -> piece of cake".

  - built with **django** and **mysql**
  - no external dependencies
  - **Api** extensions available
  - **CLI** for terminal lovers:) (*coming soon*)

### Installation

Dillinger requires [Python](https://www.python.org/) 3.x to run.

Clone this repository.

```sh
$ git clone git@github.com:nirabhratapaswi/Task-Scheduler.git
$ cd Task-Scheduler
$ pip install -r ./requirements.txt
$ python manage.py runserver
```

For production environments... (*coming soon*)

```sh
$ 
```

### Docker (*coming soon*)
Task-Scheduler is very easy to install and deploy in a Docker container.

By default, the Docker will expose port 8000, so change this within the Dockerfile if necessary. When ready, simply use the Dockerfile to build the image.

```sh
$ cd Task-Scheduler
$ # docker commands (*coming soon*)
```
This will create the Task-Scheduler image and install necessary dependencies.

### Todos

 - Write Tests
 - Add configurable Scheduling Algorithms
